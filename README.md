# Python-Project-Instacart

CareerFoundry course - Instacart grocery sales Python analysis

**Introduction**

You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

**Note:**
Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.

**Context**

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The stakeholders would like to be able to answer key questions including:

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
